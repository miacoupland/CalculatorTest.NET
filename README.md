# CalculatorTest.NET
Calculator interview test app. Using C# and Angular.

- Angular app: https://github.com/miacoupland/CalculatorTest

This task was tricky for me in that I've only been familiarising myself with C# for the past few months. Setting up a C# project from scratch to build an API is something I've never done before. My normal C# learnings are developing upon existing projects. However, I learned a lot and it highlighted areas I need to work on in future (for example, I knew how to make a controller, but not how to implement it in the wider program properly, which I have now learned how to do).

I made a few assumptions about what was asked, mainly doing a basic version of these requirements, such as the user being able to set a background colour for the modal component as the requirement to add functionality to restyle the look and feel of the popup. I also wasn't sure about what was expected in terms of responsiveness, so the calculator does scale with flex, but I did not add media queries as it didn't add much value on top of flex for this case.

Future work: 
- Handle minus numbers.
- Introduce further code coverage (limited by time constraints).
- Add further calculator customisability.
- Extract URLs to config.
- Add other operators.
- Replace deprecated code.


Couldn't commit as I went sadly due to hardware limitations meaning I couldn't use my own PC for this project and therefore had to transfer the files over. I made two repos to separate the API and Angular app.
